# 07-Developer-Profile-Generator
Command line application that generates github profile information.

HOW IT WORKS:
When this application is run in the command line (node.js) the user will be prompted for their Github profile name.
Once this name has been given, it will generate an html document with all relevant information plugged in, and then
clone that into a seperate pdf document.
